                    <p class="food-intro__text">Japanese cuisine is unique and delicious. It is also suprisingly healthy compared to North American food. When visiting Japan, eating different and new dishes is one of the best ways to experience the culture. Below, five of Japan's most popular dishes are listed.</p>

                                <p>You simply cannot ignore sushi when you visit Tokyo. The fish market (Tsukiji fish market) brings tons of fresh seafood from other parts of Japan and around the world. It is the biggest fish market in the world!</p>
                                <p>There are also about 30 Michelin-starred sushi restaurants in Toyko alone, such as Sukiyabashi Jiro and Saito. But, if you want to avoid high prices and long waits, there are countless other delicious options.</p>
                                <p>Sushi tastes the best right after it is served, so it is recommended to eat your sushi right away.</p>
                                <p>If you want wasabi, don't mix it with soy sauce. It is considered bad manners in Japan. Instead, put a little wasabi on the fish before eating.</p>

                                <p>This is one of the more traditional Japanese dishes. Yakitori is typically cooked over charcoal grills to make the meat crispy outside and tender inside. Seasoning is either (1) salt only or (2) savory tare sauce made from soy sauce, dashi broth, and vinegar.</p>
                                <p>Salt only is recommended to try first. This will allow you to best taste the natural flavor of ingredients if you are dining at a good yakitori restaurant. After trying salt only, the tare sauce is also worth trying.</p>

                                <p>It goes without saying that there are A LOT of ramen restaurants in Tokyo, and Japanese people really love ramen. It is cheap (you can get a decent one for 500 or 600 JPY) and tasty. There are multiple types of ramen based on the type of the broth.</p>
                                <p>Shoyu (Soy sauce based), Shio (Salt based), Miso, and Tonkotsu (Pork based) are the most popular types of broth.</p>
                                <p>If you are not sure which one you would like and want to try multiple types of ramen, maybe you should go to Tokyo ramen street at Tokyo station or the Ramen museum at Shin-Yokohama station. The Ramen Museum is a good option as there are around 8 ramen restaurants selected from various parts of Japan. You can try at least 2-3 different types of small ramen bowls!</p>

                                <p>Okonomiyaki is a popular dish in Japan, and people even cook it at home pretty often. At the same time, there are a lot of restaurants that specialize in Okonomiyaki in Tokyo.</p>
                                <p>Typically okonomiyaki includes flour, cabbage, scallions, and pork belly slices. It is cooked on a big hot plate and served with a sweet and salty sauce made from soy sauce.</p>
                                <p>There are multiple types of Okonomiyaki in the different regions of Japan. They differ both with the types of ingredients and in cooking method. If you are travelling around the country, it is recommended to try this dish multiple times in different places.</p>

                                <p>You may have already tried soba noodles hot. If that is the case, you should try cold soba noodles while you are in Japan. Soba is made from buckwheat flour, and smooth and refreshing.</p>
                                <p>Soba is typically served with side dishes or toppings. It goes well especially with tempura (deep fried shrimp and vegetables) as soba is pretty light by itself. It will be a good mixture of light cold soba and warm juicy tempura!</p>
                                <p>By the way, it is totally okay to slurp the noodles in Japan. In Japanese culture, this is actually a sign of respect.</p>
